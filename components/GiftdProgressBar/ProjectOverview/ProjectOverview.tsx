                <p>Welcome to Giftd, a circular economy startup and appÂ available on iOS and Android. The app allows you to gift your pre-loved clothes to your loved ones, family and neighbors. But there's a bigger issue at hand - <b>the growing problem of carbon footprint caused by clothing waste. That's where I come in.</b></p>

                <p>As a part of Giftd's road map, <b>I was tasked with designing a feature that would not only enhance user engagement but also make them invested in Giftd's mission.</b></p>
                <p>The problem we were trying to solve was how to connect users to their CO2e impact and make them aware of their contribution to the growing community of gifting.</p>

                <p>I got to work and collaborated closely with the founder, developer, and marketing team to design a reward experience that would benefit both primary users (a.k.a ambassadors) and secondary users.</p>
                <p>The solution is simple yet effective - <b>by tracking users' CO2e impact, we could make it easy for them to see how they're contributing to the growing community of gifting.</b></p>
