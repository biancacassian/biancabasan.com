        How can we celebrate the top 3-4% of engaged users with the greatest
        impact?

          To kick start the design process, I first looked into how other
          companies approach impact, particularly looking at how they
          communicate numbers and encourage engagement.

          Simultaneously, I discussed with the founder to define the feature's
          purpose and the and the value it would bring to users. The goal
          emerged: to boost engagement for primary and secondary users,
          celebrating the top 3-4% engaged users making the greatest impact.

          I took the lead in exploring the psychology of motivation and
          engagement, which eventually led me to discover the Hook Modelâ€” a
          framework for creating habit-forming products in four steps.
        </p>
        <p>
          Excited about the framework, I led a brainstorming session with the
          founder and developer, using the Hook Model to generate feature ideas.
          We concentrated on identifying desired rewards for primary users and
          designing to fulfill those needs, all while ensuring these rewards
          foster user engagement and growth.
        </p>
        <p>From the brainstorming session we gained 3 valuable insights:</p>

        <div className={empathizeStyles['square']}>
          <p>
            02. For gamification to work we need to uncover the real motivation
            / goal of the user

        <div className={empathizeStyles['square']}>

            03. We must experiment with creating a loop of triggered actions and
            unpredictable rewards for users
